##What is you site's primary purpose?##

My site's primary purpose is to act as a portfolio for what I've learnt during my time at dev academy, a way for people to get to know me a little bit, as well as a way for me to showcase some of the html, css, and js techniques I have learnt so far. 

 ##Who is your target audience?##

 Anyone on the internet, but speficically future possible employers, so that they can know what to expect from me.

 ##How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?##

 It would be cool if eventually I could add an anonymous comment section on my site for people to share their opinions.
 For now all I want is for them to be able to navigate the site with ease, and enjoy reading the content.
 Hopefully their experience will be visually delightful, and thought provoking in terms of content.

 ##How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?##

 I will build myself using the latest and best CSS techniques that I have learnt so far, including grid based design and responsive design. I would also like to restructure the Nav bar at some point to merge it into the sidebar, that way I can make room for more links, as well as making the site more compatible for mobile users. 
 I would like to take time to make my site completely responsive and integrated, rather than having isolated elements that only interact with one another nicely under certain circumstances.
